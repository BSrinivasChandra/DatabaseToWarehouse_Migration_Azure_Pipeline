# Azure Databricks
Azure Databricks provides both computation and infrastruture to run **spark** code which is an open source distributed computation ***in-memory*** framework. None the less, SQL and python scripts can also be executed.  
  
In order to execute an piece of code, a computaion resource aka **compute** is required. It is created and configured manually based on the required usage. Configuration of a compute usually includes:
- Number of cores
- Memory of compute

> NOTE: The fewer configurations, the cheaper the compute cost.
