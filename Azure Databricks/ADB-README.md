# Azure Databricks
Azure Databricks provides both computation and infrastruture to run ***spark*** code which is an open source distributed computation in=memory framework. None the less, SQL and python scripts can also be executed.  
In order to execute an piece of code, a computaion resource aka compute is required, which is to be created manually.
The compute can be configured based on the usage requirement. Configuration usually includes:
- Number of cores
- Memory of compute

> NOTE: Lesser the configurations, Cheaper the cost of the compute.
