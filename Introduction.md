Introduction:
Adventure Works, a fictitious company, maintains a comprehensive database reflecting its operations. To harness insights from this data and facilitate informed decision-making, an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline is essential. The project aims to construct a robust ETL pipeline leveraging Azure services for data transformation, storage, and visualization.

Objective:
The primary goal is to design and implement a scalable ETL pipeline that extracts data from an on-premise SQL Server database representing Adventure Works, transforms it into a suitable format for analysis, and loads it into Azure for further processing and visualization.

Project Components:

Data Extraction:
Extracting data from the on-premise SQL Server database, ensuring efficient and secure transfer to the cloud environment.
Utilizing appropriate methodologies to minimize data latency and ensure real-time or batch extraction as per requirements.
Data Transformation:
Performing data cleansing, normalization, and enrichment to enhance data quality and usability.
Implementing transformations to convert raw data into formats suitable for analytical processing.
Applying business rules and logic to derive meaningful insights from the data.
Data Loading:
Loading transformed data into Azure storage solutions for efficient storage and accessibility.
Employing best practices for data loading to optimize performance and minimize latency.
Ensuring data integrity and consistency during the loading process.
Data Analysis:
Utilizing Azure Synapse Analytics for advanced analytics, including data exploration, ad-hoc querying, and machine learning.
Leveraging Azure Databricks for scalable data processing and analytics, enabling complex transformations and predictive modeling.
Integrating with Power BI for interactive data visualization and reporting, empowering users to gain actionable insights from the data.
